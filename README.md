# Icosahedron_console
This is a console based game that takes in input from the player to create a Champion, Maverick, Soul Seer, or Whisper to navigate through a world of mystery 
where all decisions are weighted with the roll of a 20 sided die.<br>
## Progress
I have created jasmine tests, classes, and methods for: Being, Hero, Loot, Food, Weapon, Cache, and Ability.
